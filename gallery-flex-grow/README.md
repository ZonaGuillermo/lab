# A flex-grow Gallery

This time I wanted to create a gallery using a couple of effects.

First, I wanted to use the `flex-grow` property with transition which give us an expanded sense when hovering over images.

Secondly, I wanted the next and previous image to increase in size. I got thie effect using `:has()` pseudoclass.
